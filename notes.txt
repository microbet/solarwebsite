This is a project for a solar website.  Thinking about SEO when starting
with the meta tags, I thought it would be a good idea to look at the
meta tags of solar sites that place well.  I thought of doing that by
hand, but maybe doing it with a program would work and that could be
a good SEO strategy/service.
